In a Jenkinsfile, you can configure the JaCoCo coverage reporting using the `jacoco` step. Here's how you can modify your Jenkinsfile to include the JaCoCo coverage reporting:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build your Maven project
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // Archive the JUnit test results
            junit 'target/surefire-reports/**/*.xml'
        }

        success {
            // Record JaCoCo coverage report
            jacoco(execPattern: '**/target/jacoco.exec')
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `jacoco` step is used to record the JaCoCo coverage report.
- The `execPattern` parameter is set to `**/target/jacoco.exec`, specifying the path to the JaCoCo execution data file.

This assumes that your Maven build generates the JaCoCo coverage report in the default location (`target` directory) with the file name `jacoco.exec`. If your configuration is different, adjust the `execPattern` accordingly.

Make sure to replace the placeholder `**/target/jacoco.exec` with the actual path to your JaCoCo execution data file.

Save this Jenkinsfile in the root of your project repository, and when you run your Jenkins job, it should record and display the JaCoCo coverage report after a successful build.
