Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with Gradle and PMD!

PMD (Programming Mistake Detector) is a static code analysis tool that helps identify potential issues in source code. It can be integrated into your Gradle project to automatically analyze your code for common programming mistakes, style violations, and other issues.

Here's how you can set up PMD with Gradle:

1. **Add PMD Plugin**: In your Gradle project, open the `build.gradle` file and add the PMD plugin to the `plugins` block. Make sure you're using a compatible version of the PMD plugin.

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'pmd'
}
```

2. **Configure PMD**: You can configure PMD by adding a `pmd` block in your `build.gradle` file. This block allows you to customize PMD's behavior and rulesets.

```groovy
pmd {
    ruleSets = [
        'java-basic',      // Basic set of rules
        'java-unusedcode'  // Detect unused code
        // Add more rule sets as needed
    ]
    ignoreFailures = false // Set to true if you want the build to continue even if PMD finds issues
    consoleOutput = true   // Print PMD results to the console
}
```

3. **Run PMD Task**: With the PMD plugin added and configured, you can run the PMD task to analyze your code. Open a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Then, run the following command:

```sh
./gradlew pmd
```

Replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew` if you're on Windows. This command will run PMD analysis on your code based on the configured rules and generate a report.

4. **View PMD Report**: After running the PMD task, you can find the PMD report in the build directory. The default location is `build/reports/pmd`. Open the HTML report in a web browser to view the detected issues and their details.

Remember that PMD analysis should be just one part of your code quality assurance process. It's important to regularly review and address the issues reported by PMD to improve the overall quality of your codebase.
