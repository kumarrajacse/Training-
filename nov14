The Clover Maven Plugin is a tool for integrating Atlassian Clover with Apache Maven builds. Atlassian Clover is a code coverage tool for Java applications. By using the Clover Maven Plugin, you can generate code coverage reports and metrics as part of your Maven build process.

To use the Clover Maven Plugin in your Java project, you need to add the plugin configuration to your project's `pom.xml` file. Here is a basic example:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.atlassian.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>clover-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>4.1.2</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
            <configuration>
                <!-- Configuration options go here -->
            </configuration>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <phase>prepare-package</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>instrument</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
                <execution>
                    <id>default-test</id>
                    <phase>test</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>instrument-test</goal>
                        <goal>clover</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

This configuration includes two executions:

1. The first execution (`prepare-package` phase) instruments your source code with Clover during the build process.
2. The second execution (`test` phase) generates code coverage information for your tests.

Make sure to replace the version number with the latest version of the Clover Maven Plugin.

You can find more information about the Clover Maven Plugin and its configuration options in the official documentation: [Clover-for-Maven documentation](https://docs.atlassian.com/maven-clover2-plugin/latest/).


===========================================


When you use the Clover Maven Plugin to generate code coverage reports, the test results and coverage information are typically saved in the target directory of your Maven project. The exact location may vary based on your Maven project structure and configuration.

By default, Clover generates HTML reports that provide detailed information about code coverage. The main report is usually located in the `target/site/clover/index.html` file. This file contains an overview of your code coverage, including details on which lines of code were covered by tests.

Additionally, you can configure the Clover Maven Plugin to output XML and other types of reports. Here's an example configuration that specifies the output format:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.atlassian.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>clover-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>4.1.2</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
            <configuration>
                <formats>
                    <format>html</format>
                    <format>xml</format>
                </formats>
            </configuration>
            <!-- ... -->
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

With this configuration, in addition to the HTML report, Clover will generate XML reports containing detailed coverage information. The XML reports are usually located in the `target/clover/xml` directory.

Keep in mind that the exact paths and filenames may vary based on your Maven project structure and configuration. Check the generated reports in the `target` directory or the configured output directory to find the detailed test results and coverage information.
