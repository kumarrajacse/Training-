Maven itself does not have built-in linting capabilities, but we can use plugins to achieve linting-like functionality for our Java projects. Linting is a process of static code analysis to identify potential issues, errors, or code style violations in our codebase.

In Maven, we  can use the PMD (Programming Mistake Detector) plugin for code analysis and linting. PMD is a source code analyzer that finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, and so on.
In the pom.xml file. we can add  PMD plugin configuration within the <build> section ,in  PMD ruleset. we  can create our own ruleset .

Run the PMD checks:
 
mvn verify

This will execute the PMD plugin during the verify phase and generate a report on code violations

The Linting stage runs the PMD analysis and archives the generated reports.

View the PMD Reports:



Once the pipeline completes, we can view the PMD trend report in the Jenkins build job under the "PMD Report" link.

we can  find the PMD analysis results in the target/pmd directory. Look for a file named pmd.xml. This XML file contains the details of the issues found by PMD.

Remember that the specific location and filename can be customized using the plugin's configuration, but the default is the target/pmd directory. we  can specify a different output directory or filename if needed by configuring the <outputDirectory> and <outputFile> elements in the plugin's configuration.
